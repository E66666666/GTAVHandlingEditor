GTA V Real Time Handling Editor
===========

This .asi plugin will allow realtime editing of handling.meta values in-memory. Editing this way will eliminate the need to restart the game every time something has been edited, for testing purposes.

## Requirements
* Grand Theft Auto V

## Building

### Requirements
* [ScriptHookV SDK by Alexander Blade](http://www.dev-c.com/gtav/scripthookv/)

Download the [ScriptHookV SDK](http://www.dev-c.com/gtav/scripthookv/) and extract it's contents to ScriptHookV_SDK. 
Clone this repository to the same folder ScriptHookV_SDK was extracted so you have ScriptHookV_SDK and GTAVManualTransmission in the same folder. If you get build errors about missing functions, update your [natives.h](http://www.dev-c.com/nativedb/natives.h).
